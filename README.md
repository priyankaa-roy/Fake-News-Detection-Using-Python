# 📰 Detecting Fake News 🔍✨
This repository contains a Python-based solution to detect fake news using a dataset from Kaggle. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, the project identifies fake news articles with high accuracy. 🚀📈

## 🌟Project Overview
Fake news has become a widespread issue in the digital age, impacting public opinion and decision-making. 🗣️🖥️This project aims to classify news articles as real or fake by training a predictive model on labeled datasets. The pipeline includes:
- 🧹 Data preprocessing
- 🔍 Feature extraction
- 🤖 Model training
- 📊 Model evaluation

## Features
✔️ Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, text normalization)

✔️ Feature extraction using `TF-IDF vectorization`

✔️ Machine learning classification (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes)

✔️ Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score)

✔️ Python notebook for reproducibility

## 📁Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains labeled news articles categorized as real or fake.

💾Dataset: Use Kaggle to download Fake News Dataset

## ⚙️Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git](https://github.com/priyankaa-roy/Fake-News-Detection-Using-Python)
cd fake-news-detection

2. Set up a virtual environment:

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate      # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

3. Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Download the Kaggle dataset and place it in the data folder.


## 🔬Methodology

### 🧹Data Preprocessing:
- Removing null values and duplicates
- Text cleaning: lowercasing, removing punctuation, and stopword removal

### ✏️Feature Extraction:
- Using TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical form for modeling

### 🤖Model Training:
- Training classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machines

### 📊Model Evaluation:
- Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
  

## 🎯Results
Metric	Value

Accuracy	93%

Precision	93%

Recall	94%

F1 Score	93%
