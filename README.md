# Fake News Detection üì∞üîç
This repository contains a Python-based solution to detect fake news using a dataset from Kaggle. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, the project identifies fake news articles with high accuracy.
Project Overview
Fake news has become a widespread issue in the digital age, impacting public opinion and decision-making. This project aims to classify news articles as real or fake by training a predictive model on labeled datasets. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, text normalization)
Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization
Machine learning classification (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes)
Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score)
Python notebook for reproducibility
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains labeled news articles categorized as real or fake.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git
cd fake-news-detection
Set up a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate      # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the Kaggle dataset and place it in the data folder.

How to Run
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Run the notebook: Execute the cells in Detecting fake news.ipynb to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Removing null values and duplicates
Text cleaning: lowercasing, removing punctuation, and stopword removal
Feature Extraction:

Using TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical form for modeling
Model Training:

Training classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machines
Model Evaluation:

Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
Results
Metric	Value
Accuracy	95%
Precision	94%
Recall	96%
F1 Score	95%
(Note: Update these results based on the actual metrics from the notebook.)
